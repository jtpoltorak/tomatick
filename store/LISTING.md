**Category:** Productivity › Workflow & Planning

**Language:** English (United States)

**Description:**

```text
Tomomomento is a simple, free focus timer. Work in 25-minute focus sessions with short breaks in between and a longer break after every four, the rhythm made popular by the Pomodoro Technique®. Change any of the times to suit you.

It's built to stay out of your way: one click to start, a countdown on the toolbar icon, and nothing to sign up for. Sounds, notifications, and the site blocker are all off until you turn them on.

Features
• Start, pause, restart, or skip with one click, or press Space
• A countdown badge on the toolbar icon, so you can see the time left at a glance
• Optional alerts when time's up: a gentle bell, chime, or beep, and/or a desktop notification
• Optional auto-start for breaks and focus sessions
• A progress bar under the clock, today's completed sessions, and dots showing how close the long break is
• An optional site blocker that shows a "stay focused" page for the sites you choose, only during focus sessions
• A built-in guide to the technique and how to use it
• Light and dark themes that follow your system, or pick one yourself
• Optional quotes on the timer screen: focus quotes while you work, rest quotes on breaks
• Large, easy-to-read text, with keyboard and screen reader support
• Alt+Shift+P opens Tomomomento from anywhere in Chrome

Private by design
Tomomomento has no account, no ads, no analytics, and no tracking. It makes no network requests. Your settings stay in your browser.

Free and open source
Tomomomento is free and always will be. The code is open under the MIT License. It was built with Claude Code, Anthropic's AI coding assistant. Not using Chrome? The same timer runs in any browser on the website below.

What's new in 1.1
• Choose a light, dark, or system theme
• Optional quotes on the timer screen
• A progress bar under the clock
• Bigger text and controls, and Help split into tabs
• Accessibility: meets WCAG 2.2 AA in both themes
• Fixed: the "done today" count now resets at midnight

**Official URL:** optional. To use https://tomomomento.com, first verify the domain in [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) with the same Google account; otherwise skip it.

**Homepage URL:** https://tomomomento.com

**Support URL:** https://tomomomento.com/legal.html#contact (no GitHub account needed to reach you)

The description is plain text: the store doesn't turn URLs or emails in it into
links. The clickable links on the listing come from the **Homepage URL** and
**Support URL** fields above and the developer contact email (Account page,
shown under Details). That's why the description keeps its links together in
one "Links" block, where they're easy to spot and copy.

**Mature content:** No

## Privacy practices tab

**Single purpose:**

> A focus timer that alternates focus sessions and breaks.

**Permission justifications:**

| Permission                                       | Justification                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `alarms`                                         | Wakes the extension when a focus session or break ends, so the timer keeps working while the popup is closed.                                          |
| `notifications`                                  | Shows the optional "time's up" notification, which is off until the user turns it on.                                                                  |
| `offscreen`                                      | Plays the optional "time's up" sound. Service workers can't play audio, so a hidden offscreen document does it.                                        |
| `storage`                                        | Remembers the timer and the user's settings.                                                                                                           |
| `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` (optional) | Used only when the user turns on the site blocker: redirects the sites on their list to the extension's "stay focused" page during focus sessions.     |
| Host permission `<all_urls>` (optional)          | Requested only when the user turns on the site blocker, because the user can list any site; given back when they turn it off. No page content is read. |

**Data usage:** check none of the data types. Then check all three certifications:

- I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases.
- I do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to my item's single purpose.
- I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.

## Distribution tab

- **Payments:** Free of charge
- **Visibility:** Public (or Unlisted first, if you'd like to try the store install before anyone can find it)
- **Distribution:** All regions

## Publishing an update

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` (the build copies it into the manifest).
   The store rejects a zip whose version isn't higher than the published one.
2. Add the release to [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) and the "What's new"
   lines in the description above.
3. `npm run package` writes `tomomomento-<version>.zip`. If the UI changed,
   rerun `node scripts/store-images.mjs` too.
4. In the dashboard, open the item, go to **Package** > **Upload new package**,
   and upload the zip. Update the **Store listing** tab (description,
   screenshots) if they changed, then **Submit for review**. The live version
   stays up until the update is approved.
